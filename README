=== PHP Library for Getty Connect's API ===
Accessing images from Getty through Getty Connect is (at least) a four step process:

1 - Create a session
2 - Search for images
3 - Request Download
4 - Retrieve Large File

This library was built during a hackathon and is therefore not all that robust or elegant :) But it is functional and requires no specific php frameworks!
